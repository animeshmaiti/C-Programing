### 1). WAP to find the smallest and most significant element stored in a dynamic array of n integers using the Bubble Sort algorithm using descending order conditions. Also, show all the possible conditions of the algorithm.(<green>qus-1.c</green>)

### 2). WAP to find the most significant number and count the occurrence of the largest number in a Dynamic Array of n integers using a single loop(Using Selection Sort). Also, print the memory locations of the largest and smallest numbers.(<green>selection_short.c</green>)

### 3). WAP to store n employeeâ€™s data such as employee name, gender, designation, department, and basic pay using Structure. Calculate the gross pay of each employee as follows:
           Gross pay = basic pay + HR + DA
           HR=25% of basic and DA=75% of basic. 
Also, solve problem 3 using by Passing Structure to a Function.(<green>salary_function.c</green>)
