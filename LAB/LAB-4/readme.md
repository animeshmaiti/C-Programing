### (i) WAP to create a linked list that represents a polynomial expression with a single variable (i.e. 5x7-3x5+x2+9) and display the polynomial by using user-defined functions for creation and display.

### (ii) A matrix m × n that has relatively few non-zero entries is called a sparse matrix. It may be represented in much less than m × n space. An m × n matrix with k non-zero entries is sparse if k << m × n. It may be faster to represent the matrix compactly as a list of the non-zero indexes and associated entries. WAP to represent a sparse matrix using a linked list.

### (iii) WAP to convert an infix expression into its equivalent postfix notation using Dynamic Array.
